    "In this project, data cleaning process is conducted. There are 4 main questions to consider: 1) Can you make the salary column into integers?; 2) What information can you extract out of job descriptions?; 3) How can you remove the numbers from the company name?; 4) How can you create some new features? (e.g. state column from the location column). After these 4 questions, there were performed additional modifications over data. Finally, a cleaned dataset is presented."
